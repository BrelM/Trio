// Guidelines for the gameLoop method in MainGameUI:

// Present the main screen with three main sections in a horizontal layout
// 1. First section in the leftmost part of the screen contains buttons corresponding to teams/players
//    Clicking on one of them reveals the validated competences
// 2. Second section in the middle changes according to the instant. It could display the turn menu,
//    it could display the options relatives to a selected option of the turn menu.
//    In case, the player wanted to draw a card from the center pile, it should display the available
//    cards as buttons.
// 3. Third section in the rightmost part of the screen represent the log of the turn. It contains only
//    the informations the current player is allowed to see (the card he drew during the turn,
//    the announcements). It is cleared then updated everytime a player takes a turn.
// Everytime a card needs to be represented, a simple button might be enough. Use the createButton method.

// This method uses GameLoop class' play and playTurn methods.
